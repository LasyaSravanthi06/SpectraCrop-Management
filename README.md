# SpectraCrop-Management
SpectraCrop Management System
SpectraCrop Management is a web-based application that leverages satellite data and machine learning to provide farmers with actionable recommendations on crop health, pesticide use, and irrigation management. This tool helps farmers access remote sensing data and environmental information, enabling precision agriculture practices to enhance crop yield and sustainability.

Project Overview
The SpectraCrop Management System allows users to input various crop-related and environmental parameters, such as NDVI, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Based on these inputs, the application provides recommendations for optimal crop management.

The data, derived from satellite sources and weather reports, offers insights into crop health and conditions across vast agricultural areas. This is especially beneficial for large farms or inaccessible regions where physical inspection is challenging.

Features
Crop Health Analysis: Leverages NDVI values from satellite data to assess vegetation health.
Environmental Monitoring: Inputs for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture to provide real-time recommendations.
Actionable Recommendations: Offers suggestions for fertilizer, pesticide, and water use based on entered data.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple form-based UI allowing farmers to enter data manually or via other sources.
Backend Integration: Connects to a backend API for real-time data processing and recommendation generation.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express
Machine Learning: Python, scikit-learn (for recommendation algorithms)
Satellite Data: Integration with external satellite data sources (e.g., Sentinel-2, MODIS)
Database: MongoDB (optional, for data storage)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (for backend setup)
Python and pip (for machine learning model)
MongoDB (if using a database for data storage)
Access to satellite data sources (e.g., NDVI data from external platforms or APIs)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpectraCrop-Management.git
cd SpectraCrop-Management
Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the backend directory and install necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Install Frontend Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory (if applicable) and install necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following variables:

env
Copy code
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_uri
API_KEY=your_satellite_data_api_key
Run the Backend

Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Run the Frontend

Start the React frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm start
Usage
Open the Application

Once the backend and frontend servers are running, open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3001.

Enter Crop and Environmental Data

Enter values for crop type, NDVI, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Farmers can retrieve NDVI and environmental data from weather services or agriculture platforms.

Get Recommendations

Click the "Get Recommendations" button. The application will display suggestions on crop health, pesticide use, and water management.

Sample Input
Here’s a sample input to try:

Crop Type: wheat
NDVI Value: 0.5
Soil Moisture: 30
Temperature: 25°C
Humidity: 60%
